## Setup

1. Clone the sample app from this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rookout/tutorial-java.git
cd tutorial-java
``` 

2. Set your Rookout Token as an environment variable (for Windows, use ***set*** instead of ***export)

```bash
export ROOKOUT_TOKEN=[Your Rookout Token]
 ```

3. Build and run the app

Build and run the app using Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew bootJar run
```

- Optional - Run the app using docker (Java & Gradle are not required)

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e "ROOKOUT_TOKEN=[Your Rookout Token]" rookout/tutorial-java
```

## Usage

    #### Adding source code
    
    1. Click on Add source
    1. Choose source control
        - Github
            - Click on Connect
            - Authorize O-Auth
            - Fill `Repository Owner`
            - Click `Repository` and choose from the dropdown menu
            - Click Next
            - Choose the desired branch
            - Click View Repository
        - Local FileSystem - Server
            - Click on Setup Server
            - Choose a supported HTTP Server
            - Follow the on-screen instructions
    </p>
    </details>
    
    
- Open the file `src/main/java/com/rookout/tutorial/TodoController.java`    
![TodoController.java](/img/screenshots/java-tutorial_1.png)

- Add a Breakpoint to the `addTodo` function by clicking next the line number in the file viewer
![Snapshot Breakpoint](/img/screenshots/java-tutorial_2.png)

- Click on the **Breakpoints** tab in the left pane, and you will see the Breakpoint and the line number where you added it - it should be solid purple.

    - **If this is not the case, [check our troubleshooting guide](https://docs.rookout.com/docs/breakpoints-status.html)**
     
- Go the the app page - [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and add try to add a task to the todo list

![Add Task](/img/screenshots/java-tutorial_4.png)

- Check the bottom pane **Messages** and you'll see the dumpframe you just added - it was triggered by the handler of the web page when you accessed it!

## Common Pitfalls

- Breakpoint status is RED -- Hash mismatch. It means the file used in the server is not the same file used from github/local server in app.rookout.com
- Breakpoint status is GRAY -- No app connected. Make sure you have inserted the Rookout Token in the right place and that connection is made properly.

## Bug Hunt

Great! You're now ready to start debugging, let's start by having some fun with our 
[bug hunt](tutorials-bughunt-java.md) - follow the instructions to try out some basic use cases.
