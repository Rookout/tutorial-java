## Prerequisites


1. Java 8
2. Docker (optional) - https://www.docker.com/get-docker
3. Jaegar Agent - https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/getting-started/

## Setup

1. Clone the sample app from this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rookout/tutorial-java.git
cd tutorial-java
``` 

2. Set your Rookout Token as an environment variable (for Windows, use ***set*** instead of ***export)

```bash
export ROOKOUT_TOKEN=[Your Rookout Token]
 ```

3. This application uses Jaegar for tracing and requires the Jaegar agent be running before starting the application. The simplest approach to setting this up would be to start the All-In-One pre-built Docker image as described here: https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.22/getting-started/#all-in-one.

4. After starting Jaegar, ensure that the file `src/main/resources/application.properties` is updated with the host and port of your Jaegar agent. For example:

```bash
opentracing.jaeger.udp-sender.host=localhost
opentracing.jaeger.udp-sender.port=6831
```
- You can omit using Jaeger and remove the `opentracing.jaeger.udp-sender.host` and `opentracing.jaeger.udp-sender.port` options from the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

5. Build and run the app

Build and run the app using Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew bootJar run
```

- Optional - Run the app using docker (Java & Gradle are not required)

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e "ROOKOUT_TOKEN=[Your Rookout Token]" rookout/tutorial-java
```

- No Jaeger? If you just want to take the docker image for a spin without Jaeger then you can disable it by adding the `--opentracing.jaeger.enabled=false` argument:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e "ROOKOUT_TOKEN=[Your Rookout Token]" rookout/tutorial-java --opentracing.jaeger.enabled=false
```

## Usage

- Log in to [the Rookout IDE][rookout-app-url].
- Select the server(s) to debug based on the labels in the server selection screen
- Add the source code according to the instructions using the left pane **Source View**

    #### Adding source code
    
    1. Click on Add source
    1. Choose source control
        - Github
            - Click on Connect
            - Authorize O-Auth
            - Fill `Repository Owner`
            - Click `Repository` and choose from the dropdown menu
            - Click Next
            - Choose the desired branch
            - Click View Repository
        - Local FileSystem - Server
            - Click on Setup Server
            - Choose a supported HTTP Server
            - Follow the on-screen instructions
    </p>
    </details>
    
    
- Open the file `src/main/java/com/rookout/tutorial/TodoController.java`    
![TodoController.java](/img/screenshots/java-tutorial_1.png)

- Add a Breakpoint to the `addTodo` function by clicking next the line number in the file viewer
![Snapshot Breakpoint](/img/screenshots/java-tutorial_2.png)

- Click on the **Breakpoints** tab in the left pane, and you will see the Breakpoint and the line number where you added it - it should be solid purple.

    - **If this is not the case, [check our troubleshooting guide](https://docs.rookout.com/docs/breakpoints-status.html)**
     
- Go the the app page - [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and add try to add a task to the todo list

![Add Task](/img/screenshots/java-tutorial_4.png)

- Check the bottom pane **Messages** and you'll see the dumpframe you just added - it was triggered by the handler of the web page when you accessed it!

## Common Pitfalls

- Breakpoint status is pending (hollow with purple outline) -- Connection to the app was not able to be established. Make sure that you inserted the Rookout Token in the right place and that the SDK was properly installed.
- Breakpoing status is disabled (solid grey) -- The breakpoint was disabled from collecting more data due to the limits being hit.
- Brekapoint error -- something went wrong. Check the breakpoint status to get more information on the error type, and for more information go to our [breakpoint status guide][https://docs.rookout.com/docs/breakpoints-status/].

## Bug Hunt

Great! You're now ready to start debugging, let's start by having some fun with our 
[bug hunt](tutorials-bughunt-java.md) - follow the instructions to try out some basic use cases.
