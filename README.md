- Looking at the right-hand pane **Rules**, you will see the rule and the line number where you added it - it should be <span style="color: #73CD1F;">**GREEN**</span>   
    ![Valid Rule](/img/screenshots/java-tutorial_3.png)
    - **If this is not the case, [check our troubleshooting guide](https://docs.rookout.com/docs/troubleshooting-rules.html)**
     
- Go the the app page - [http://localhost:8089/](http://localhost:8089/) and add try to add a task to the todo list

![Add Task](/img/screenshots/java-tutorial_4.png)

- Check the bottom pane **Messages** and you'll see the dumpframe you just added - it was triggered by the handler of the web page when you accessed it!

## Rule Common Issues

- Rule status is RED -- Hash mismatch. It means the file used in the server is not the same file used from github/local server in app.rookout.com
- Rule status is GRAY -- No rook connected to the agent. Make sure you have inserted the token in the right place and that connection is made properly.

## Bug Hunt
